# Running a Artificial Intelligence application as a Slurm job

Typically, an Artificial Intelligence application/script uses Python, and you have the following options to manage the project dependencies:

1. Using Python's Virtual Environment
2. Using Conda
3. Using Docker

## Slurm and Python's Virtual Environment
To submit a Python application that uses Python's Virtual Environments for dependency management and project isolation as a Slurm job, you need to perform the following tasks:

1. Create the Python Virtual Environment with the project dependencies
2. Define the Slurm job script
3. Submit the Slurm job

## Slurm and Conda
To submit a Python application that uses Conda for dependency management and project isolation as a Slurm job, you need to perform the following tasks:

1. Create the Conda environment with the project dependencies
2. Define the Slurm job script
3. Submit the Slurm job
